# Node JS Chat app
## How to use

Running the node server 
 ```sh
cd nodesocket
npm i
npm start
```
Running the react client
 ```sh
cd reactclient
npm i
npm start
```

### The client and server are running, what now?
Open two or more browser windows to localhost:3000. You can now send messages on one browser and witness them appear in real time on the other.
#### It's not working!
Be sure that both client and server are running and that the server is running on port 5000.
